      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello. I am learning to become a software developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in California and lived there until I was 10 years old. After that, I lived in Washington state and MA for years before recently returning to California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love reading, gaming, politics, and spending time outdoors.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be to work developing software on a project that is entertaining or something I'm passionate about.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Corona, CA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I became interested in coding in high school, but I didn't think to make it a career until I was already out of college. As I've worked in other jobs, some of my favorite tasks have been ones that require me to use complicated Excel formulas, custom filters in SalesForce, or other similar tasks. I was not happy in my previous career and decided switching to web development would be a good career for me considering my interests and which parts of previous jobs I had enjoyed.</p>
